<li> 2021-04-03 Fishing tip #0: you can always ask me anything about fishing, i will likely be able to help. I also know many lakes, strawberry and fishlake I know more about than any others. I will get you some research on lakes if you need it and don't know much about where you are going.</li>
<li> 2021-04-03 Fishing tip #1: When using metal lures, use gold in sun hit spots of the water, silver in shade or in clouds.</li>
<li> 2021-04-01 Fishing tip #2: don't rest, morning fishing is best</li>
<li> 2021-04-03 Fishing tip #3: avoid harsh smells: avoid touching anything the fish is meant to see, smell, or bite with anything that smells harsh to the fish. This includes sun block, cigarette smoke, and other human objects that could influence the fish. However, anything meant to attract the fish should and will be touched, only try to avoid touching things that would repel them.</li>
<li> 2021-04-03 Fishing tip #4: White, chartreuse like green, orange, pink, yellow, some red, are good colors and are ranked. However, each color will work at different times so this is not always true. Silver and gold cannot be ranked with these.</li>
<li> 2021-04-03 Fishing tip #5: the only true absolute about fishing, is that there are no absolutes in fishing. Anything can and will catch fish, and at any time, but these tips help to make more consistent results.</li>
<li> 2021-04-03 Fishing tip #6: larger storms will slow fishing down very much. This is because the fish’s air bladder, which controls their buoyancy so they can rise and sink in the water, becomes disturbed from the barometric pressure. The fish will not feed when their air bladder is changing pressure.</li>
<li> 2021-04-04 Fishing tip #7: For anything any of you would use it for, only use open faced reels, or spinning reels. Never, Never use a reel that uses a button, or a closed face reel. Closed face reels are terrible, can barely cast, tangle frequently, difficult to change line etc. Spinning reels, or open faced, meaning you can see all of the line and is surrounded by a metal bar, are infinitely better. The closed faced ones may seem better, but they are not. To cast a spinning reel: hold pole in dominant hand, just above reel, and hold line to pole with index finger, using non dominant hand, flip bail, or metal bar, then pull ple back and “throw” forward, letting go of line at precise moment. While using casting motion, it would be good to hold the pole beneath the reel with non-dominant hand in case your other hand slipped. After line hits water, flip bail down, and reel in slack</li>
<li> 2021-04-04 Fishing tip #8: I use one type of knot excessively, and it has no name, because it is a varied version of a popular knot. This is the best knot and I will give a description of it later. The only fishing knot by name that is good to me, is the palomar knot. It would be easier to see this through pictures than a short description.</li>
<li> 2021-04-06 Fishing tip #9: setting the hook. Setting the hook means to set the hook into the fishes mouth, it digs the hook in deep enough that the barb will pass through the mouth. On small bites where the pole just barely twitches for a split second, it would be advised to avoid setting the hook, however, the hook still can be set in this situation. It is best to avoid setting small bites when the lure is something that would attract bites away from the hook, as the fish are likely not biting hard enough for the hook to enter their mouths. Lures like this are jigs, or lures with the hook in the center of the lure. Small bites should be hooked at times when a lure with a hook at the back end of the lure is used. Examples of this are spinners, spoons, wedding ring style lures, or anything else with a hook towards the back. These types of lures should be hooked with small bites because even if the fish is biting a small portion of the lure, it is likely still biting the hook. Any bite that physically moves the tip of the pole a visible amount should at least be attempted to be hooked. When setting the hook, jerk the pole back, unless weight suddenly drops in the middle of the jerk in which you would drop the line back down and try for another bite. If, after setting the hook, there is still a fish on, reel in.</li>
<li> 2021-04-12 Fishing tip #10: Usually, fishing will slow down some as the day transitions from morning to afternoon. The afternoon is still usually a good time to fish, and is dependent on the weather, moon phase and season for when it is the best. In the spring, summer, and fall, fishing in the afternoon is best when the weather is calm, sun hitting the water, and the less the moon is visible the better. Times of full moons will bring slow fishing, times of new moon bring faster fishing</li>
<li> 2021-04-12 Fishing tip #11: for fishing on the shore, the worst time to fish is during large storms, full moons and the middle of summer, although, exceptions can happen during each of these possiblities</li>
<li> 2021-04-12 Fishing tip #12: fishing tips and information found from some guy on the internet is not as trustworthy as what i say. There is a good chance he is just screwing with you, while I am actually trying to help</li>
<li> 2021-04-26 Fishing tip #13: Jake's lures are metal fishing lures that are either spinner or spoons and either come in gold or silver. These also have red dots on them to make them resemble dominos. As long as you follow the rule for gold and silver in tip 1, the spinner and spoon models are quite similar in performance. However, myself and a few sources would say that usually, a spinner of the same color and type would catch at least some more fish than the spoon model. The exception to this is if the lure is used stagnantly, in which case, the spinner has no use, but the spoon can be useful.</li>
<li> 2021-04-26 Fishing tip #14: typical weight for fishing? For average conditions and average gear being used, you will usually use less than a quarter ounce of weight. But, it should be remembered that when it comes to weight, less is best. Can it sometimes depend on reaction time or personal preference? My use of weights is almost always personal preference, however, I rely on certain conditions such as wind and desired depth to determine if I need more weight. What is the weight that is always okay to use? For use on shore, small split shot sinkers about the size of a pea work perfectly. This weight can be decreased or increased based on personal preference, wind, weight of used lure, and method of fishing, (casting, jigging, etc.)Is it necessary to use weights? Realistically, the use of weights is only necessary if you are using a very lightweight lure, such as 1/16 ounce or any lure that is too small to cast efficiently. You will also want to add more weight in more windy conditions, as the wind will cause the water to move making the lure shallower than desired. Can water and the type of fish effect the weight used? Only you can decide how much weight to use. Can weight actually affect the fish species or weight of the fish caught? Yes, but in specific situations. Larger fish will generally hold in deeper water, so some weight, or more depending on depth, may be required to reach these depths.</li>
<li> 2021-04-26 Fishing tip #15: when standing on the shore while fishing, never face into the wind. Never, never, never, never cast a line into the wind as that wind may very well push that lure right back at you and...you lose an eye. When fishing on the shore cast with the wind to your back or to your sides.</li>
<li> 2021-04-27 Fishing tip #16: If a lure comes with a hook, that same hook should be used as it is much simpler than changing it. If you were to make a new setup with a hook, or were to replace one, I would recommend size 6 single hooks, unless the lure would make more sense with a treble hook.</li>
